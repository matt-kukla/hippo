Hippo is a multipurpose Beamer theme using the color scheme of George
Washington University. It is designed to be simple and minimalistic.

## Installation
To install, download the `sty` files and directly
include them in your projects.  You can clone the [git
repository](https://github.com/matt-kukla/hippo) or download as a
[zip](https://github.com/matt-kukla/hippo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
See [sample.pdf](samples/sample.pdf)
Once this has been done, the theme can be used by including 
`\usetheme{hippo}` in your document.  It's also possible to use the
color selection with another theme by invoking `\usecolortheme{hippo}`, although
you may need to tweak some settings to obtain a uniform look.

## Samples
See the sample [code](sample.tex) and [PDF](samples/sample.pdf).
